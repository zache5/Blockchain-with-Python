# Blockchain-with-Python

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for a basic blockchain ledger written in Python. The ledger uses the concept of blocks to store financial transaction records and uses proof of work to secure the integrity of the chain.

## Technologies
The following libraries are required to run the code in this repository:

streamlit,
dataclasses,
typing,
datetime,
pandas,
hashlib

## Installation Guide
import streamlit as st,
from dataclasses import dataclass,
from typing import Any, List,
import datetime as datetime,
import pandas as pd,
import hashlib

## Usage
To run the code, navigate to the directory containing the code and run the following command in a terminal:
streamlit run PyChain.py -  This will launch a user interface using Streamlit that allows you to enter financial transaction information and store it in the blockchain ledger. You can also view the current state of the blockchain and verify its validity.
